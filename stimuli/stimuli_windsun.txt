The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger
when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could 
but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him
and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt
Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak
And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two
