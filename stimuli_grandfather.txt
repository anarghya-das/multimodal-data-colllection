You wished to know all about my grandfather
Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old
He dresses in an ancient black frock coat, usually minus several buttons
yet he still thinks as swiftly as ever
A long, flowing beard clings to his chin giving those who observe him a pronounced feeling of the utmost respect
When he speaks his voice is just a bit cracked and quivers a trifle
Twice each day he plays skillfully and with zest upon our small organ
Except in the winter when the ooze or snow or ice prevents, he slowly takes a short walk in the open air each day
We have often urged him to walk more and smoke less, but he always answers, "Banana Oil!"
Grandfather likes to be modern in his language.
